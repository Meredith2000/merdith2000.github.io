<li>  The program design</li>
<li>  Application system</li>
<li>  Software engineering</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-crisis"><a href="#software-crisis" class="headerlink" title="software crisis"></a>software crisis</h2><p><strong>Three periods in the development of computer software</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  Early era (before the mid-1960s) the programming phaseGeneral hardware, special software; The program is small in size, and the writer and user are the same person (in the same group)</li>
<li>  Second generation (mid-1960s - mid-1970s) program system phaseEmergence of “software workshop”, product software; A “personalized” development approach.</li>
<li>  Third generation (after mid-1970s) software engineering phaseSoftware development has become a new engineering discipline - software engineering.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what is a software crisis?</strong></p>
<p>Software crisis refers to a series of serious problems encountered in the development and maintenance of computer software.</p>
<p><strong>two main problem</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  How to develop software, how to meet the growing demand for software.</li>
<li>  How to maintain an ever-expanding supply of software</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major manifestations of the software crisis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  Inaccurate estimates of software development costs and schedules.</li>
<li>  The user is not satisfied</li>
<li>  Software quality is not high, reliability is poor</li>
<li>  Software is often unmaintainable and errors are difficult to correct.</li>
<li>  Lack of proper documentation</li>
<li>  The software cost accounts for the system total cost proportion to rise year by year</li>
<li>  The speed of software development can not keep pace with that of computers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The cause of the software crisis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  It’s about the nature of the software itself.</li>
<li>  Software is not easy to maintain</li>
<li>  In the process of software development, more or less adopted the wrong methods and techniques.</li>
<li>  Without a complete and accurate understanding of the user’s needs, I rushed into writing the program.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to eliminate the software crisis?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  Technical measuresUse better software development methods and tools</li>
<li>  The software development of organization and management This is not a mysterious skill of individual labor, but a kind of engineering project which is well organized, tightly managed, coordinated and completed by all kinds of personnel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-engineering"><a href="#software-engineering" class="headerlink" title="software engineering"></a>software engineering</h2><p><strong>What is software engineering?</strong></p>
<p>Software engineering is an engineering subject that guides the development and maintenance of computer software. It adopts the concept, principle, technology and method of engineering to develop and maintain software, which combines the management technology which has been proved to be correct by time test with the best technical method that can be obtained at present. Software engineering is a subject involving the research and application of the principles, methods and tools of software planning, requirement analysis, design, coding, testing and maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the software life cycle divided into phases?</strong></p>
<p>One of the common strategies used by human beings in solving complex problems is to break down each problem, that is, to decompose the problem and then solve each sub problem separately. The “life cycle method” adopted in software engineering is to decompose the complex problems of software development and maintenance from the perspective of time. It divides the long life cycle of software into several stages in turn. Each stage has relatively independent tasks, and then gradually complete the tasks of each stage.</p>
<p><strong>How to divide it?</strong></p>
<p>Software life cycle is generally divided into three periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>  software definition (problem definition, feasibility study, requirement analysis)</li>
<li>  software development (overall design, detailed design, coding and unit testing, comprehensive testing)</li>
<li>  software maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the characteristics of each stage?</strong></p>

<h2 id="Software-development-process-model"><a href="#Software-development-process-model" class="headerlink" title="Software development process model"></a>Software development process model</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>waterfall model**</strong>advantages**</p>
<ul>
<li><p>  Accepts the work object of the activity from the previous activity as input 。</p>
</li>
<li><p>  What should be done to implement the activity using this input</p>
</li>
<li><p>  Give the output of the activity to the next activity</p>
</li>
<li><p>  Review the implementation of the activity.If its work is confirmed, it will proceed to the next activity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>*disadvantages**</p>
</li>
<li><p>  From the perspective of epistemology, human cognition is a process that is repeated many times and cannot be completed at once. However, the several stages divided in the waterfall model do not reflect the repetitive nature of this cognitive process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>  Software development is a knowledge-intensive development activity that requires mutual cooperation to complete, but the waterfall model does not reflect this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prototype model**</strong>advantages**</p>
<ul>
<li><p>  The prototype method is much better than the traditional life cycle method in getting a good definition of requirements. It can deal with fuzzy requirements, and developers and users can fully communicate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>  The prototype system can be used as a training environment, which is conducive to the synchronization of user training and development, and the development process is also a learning process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>  The prototype gives the user the opportunity to change the unreasonable final system in mind.</p>
</li>
<li><p>  The prototype can develop a flexible computer system with low risk.</p>
</li>
<li><p>  prototypes increase opportunities to make the system more maintainable and user-friendly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>  The prototype reduces the total development cost and time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>*disadvantages**</p>
</li>
<li><p>  Model effects or insight into areas that developers are not familiar with using the minor parts as the main framework to make irrelevant prototypes</p>
</li>
<li><p>  Prototype iterations do not converge to the developer’s prior goal of making each change, and in order to eliminate errors, the minor parts get larger and larger, overwhelming the major parts</p>
</li>
<li><p>  The prototype converges too quickly to the requirements set and ignores some basic points</p>
</li>
<li><p>  Resource planning and management can be difficult, and updating documents at any time can be troublesome</p>
</li>
<li><p>  Long-term development on the prototype environment, only pay attention to the satisfactory prototype, easy to forget the differences between the user environment and the prototype environment</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>  <strong>Fountain model</strong>The fountain model assumes that the phases of the software life cycle overlap and iterateMainly used in object-oriented methods</p>
</li>
<li><p>  <strong>Helix model</strong>Based on the prototype, the spiral model is formed by repeated prototype iteration and increased risk assessment</p>
</li>
