<li>  Project approval</li>
<li>  Project plan</li>
<li>  Requirement development</li>
<li>  Design &amp; Achievement</li>
<li>  Test</li>
<li>  Release</li>
<li>  Node term</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<p>This stage mainly includes <strong>project management</strong> and <strong>project review</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Project management</strong> mainly includes business demand research, market research, technical feasibility study, etc. In this process, <em>Business Demand Research Report</em>, <em>Market Research Report</em>, <em>Technical Feasibility Analysis Report</em> and <em>Project Application Report</em> shall be formed.</p>
<p><strong>Project review</strong> shall organize a formal review of the Project Application Report.</p>
<p>The overall plan of the project includes determining the project scope, life cycle model,work breakdown, estimating project size, workload, schedule, cost, and required resources.</p>
<p>Subordinate plans mainly include configuration management plans, quality assurance plans, measurement and analysis plans, risk management plans, and training plans.</p>
<p><strong>Test phase</strong> When the testing phase is completed, a formal review meeting is held to analyze the test report and results and make a decision on whether the product can be finalized</p>
<p><strong>Release stage</strong> This stage mainly includes activities such as product confirmation (such as product trial operation, customer acceptance testing, etc.), product conversion (for hardware + embedded software products), and official product launch.</p>
<p><strong>Closing phase</strong> This stage mainly includes archiving and confirmation of results, writing project summary reports, enriching project experience and process documents into the organization’s process wealth library, and enriching reusable resources generated in the project into the reusable basic library.</p>
<h2 id="Professional-Quality"><a href="#Professional-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Professional Quality"></a>Professional Quality</h2><ul>
<li>  A document habitGood documentation is an important part of the formal r&amp;d process. As a developer, it is normal to spend 30% of your working time writing technical documentation. As a senior developer and systems analyst, the percentage is much higher. Without documentation, a software system will lack vitality, and will encounter great trouble in future error-checking, upgrade and module reuse.</li>
<li>  Standardized and standardized coding habitsAs a formal software company’s rules, the variable naming of the code, the format of the comment in the code, and even the length of the indentation of the lines in the nest and the number of blank lines between functions are clearly defined. Good writing habits not only help code migration Error correction also facilitates collaboration between different technicians. The code has good readability and is a basic quality for developers.</li>
<li>  Reusable, modular thinkingReusable design, modular thinking is that when developers complete any functional module or function, they must think more, don’t limit themselves to the simple idea of completing the current task, think about whether the module can be separated from this system Whether it can be directly referenced in other systems and application environments by simply modifying the parameters, so that repetitive development work can be greatly avoided.</li>
<li>  Testing HabitsIn a formal software company, a full-time test engineer is indispensable, but it does not mean that with a full-time test engineer, developers can not perform self-tests; software development as a project, a very important feature is problem detection. The sooner it is solved, the lower the cost of solution. Developers carefully test each piece of code and each sub-module after completion, and can try to find and solve some potential problems as early as possible, so that the efficiency of the overall system construction and Maximum reliability is guaranteed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Personal-Quality"><a href="#Personal-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Personal Quality"></a>Personal Quality</h2><ul>
<li>  Requirements understanding ability Developers need to understand the full requirements of a module. Many developers write programs that focus on a single functional requirement. They attribute performance metrics to the hardware, operating system, and development environment, while ignoring the performance considerations of their code.Among the performance requirements, stability, support capability and security are very important. As a developer, it is necessary to evaluate the environment in which the module is operating, the load pressure it will be subjected to, and the possibility of various potential dangers and malicious attacks.</li>
<li>  Ability to learn and summarize Good at learning, for any career, is necessary to move forward, for developers, this kind of demand is even higher.But study also want to find the target, blind pursuit of some superficial, superficial things and nouns, will never have a qualitative improvement.Good at summary, is also a reflection of learning ability, each completion of a research and development task, complete a piece of code, should have a purpose to track the application of the program and user feedback, summary at any time, find their own shortcomings, so that gradually improve, a developer can grow up.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Career-Development"><a href="#Career-Development" class="headerlink" title="Career Development"></a>Career Development</h2><ul>
<li>  The First Difficulty： threat from tiger Developers have to face a lot of hungry tigers. For example, leaders seem to be the natural enemies of developers. The most common complaints of developers are what they don’t know about technology, what they don’t get and what they don’t pay. Developers can only face the reality when they encounter such problems.</li>
<li>  The Second Difficulity：Bill’s competition Generally speaking, most of the developers in China eat “youth meal”, and most of them are in the golden age of 24-28 years old. By the age of 30, a lot of young developers will bring you great competitive pressure. Learning ability, salary requirements, life burden, etc. will make you almost never have the courage to start from scratch. As the old Chinese saying goes, “the waves behind the Yangtze River are pushing the waves ahead, and a generation of new people are replacing the old ones”. This historical law is especially obvious and cruel in the software development industry. If a person has been working in personnel development, the inevitable result is to reduce wages and even unemployment.</li>
<li>  The Third Difficulity：Self strength We all know that the most difficult thing for people to overcome is themselves, so self is the biggest obstacle that developers need to overcome. Most developers regard system analysts and project managers as their career goals, but the achievement of these goals requires personal quality, market opportunities and many other conditions. Too many developers just waste their time in the state of high failure and low failure</li>
<li>  Coping with difficulties：Make career planning Quality of system analyst: customer demand analysis ability, system architecture and design ability, module decomposition design ability, project process control ability, project risk assessment ability, etc. Quality of Project Manager: team organization ability, communication and coordination ability, problem-solving ability and good professional ethics. Personal development can only rely on personal learning and efforts of developers.</li>
